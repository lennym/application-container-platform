# Flow for new users
This document will go over the flow for getting access to our various services if you are finding difficulties with the specifics of the tasks outlined in this document please see the more detailed [Developer Docs][developer docs link].

## Office 365 Account
[Office 365](https://portal.office.com) accounts are provided by the Office 365 team, Single Sign On (SSO) is managed as part of an on-boarding process, which will be managed by your project manager / delivery manager to the Office 365 team. This is not managed by us. Please note that to use SSO, which is using your Office 365 account to log onto other services, pop-ups will need to be enabled on your computer.

## VPN
VPN profiles are used to be able to get through to our multiple AWS environments as well as other data centers. The profiles can be downloaded from [access](https://access-acp.digital.homeoffice.gov.uk) which you can access using your Office 365 SSO. The following services can be only accessed when connected to the Dev VPN profile.
